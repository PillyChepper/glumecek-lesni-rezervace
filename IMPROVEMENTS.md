# Project Improvements Completed

## ✅ Completed Improvements

### 1. Removed Unused Components
- Deleted `src/components/Map.tsx` (unused, LeafletMap is preferred)
- Deleted `src/components/Calendar.tsx` (unused)
- Deleted `src/components/sections/CalendarSection.tsx` (not imported anywhere)
- Deleted `src/utils/bookedDates.ts` (deprecated)

### 2. Fixed Toast Imports
- Standardized all toast imports to use `@/hooks/use-toast`
- Updated `src/components/reservation/form/useReservationForm.ts`
- Updated `src/pages/Rezervace.tsx`

### 3. Implemented Proper Logging
- Created `src/utils/logger.ts` with structured logging
- Replaced console statements in key files:
  - `src/components/LeafletMap.tsx`
  - `src/components/sections/LocationSection.tsx`
  - `src/components/reservation/form/useReservationForm.ts`
  - `src/pages/Index.tsx`

### 4. Enhanced Type Safety
- Created `src/types/global.d.ts` with proper Mapy.cz type definitions
- Added comprehensive interfaces for Mapy.cz API integration
- This provides autocompletion and type checking for window.SMap usage

## 📋 Future Considerations

### 5. React Hook Form Integration
- Consider migrating reservation form to React Hook Form for better:
  - Form validation
  - Performance (fewer re-renders)
  - Type safety with form data
  - Reduced prop drilling

### 6. Additional Improvements to Consider
- Remove remaining console statements in date picker hooks
- Consider lazy loading for admin components
- Evaluate unused dependencies (@react-google-maps/api might not be needed)
- Implement error boundaries for better error handling

## 🗺️ Map Components Clarification

Only `LeafletMap.tsx` is being used in the application. The old `Map.tsx` component (which used Mapy.cz directly) has been removed. The current setup shows both logos because:
- LeafletMap uses Leaflet library for the interactive map
- It includes Mapy.cz tile layers as the map tiles provider
- A custom control shows the Mapy.cz logo with a link to the location

This is the correct and intended setup - one component using Leaflet with Mapy.cz tiles.

## 🔒 Type Safety Improvements

### Mapy.cz Types
- Added comprehensive type definitions in `global.d.ts`
- Covers all Mapy.cz API surfaces used in the codebase
- Provides IntelliSense and compile-time checking

### Supabase Types
- Types are auto-generated in `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
- Ensure this file is regenerated when database schema changes
- Use Supabase CLI: `supabase gen types typescript --local > types.ts`

## 📊 Console Statement Cleanup
Reduced from 75+ console statements to structured logging. Remaining console statements are mostly in:
- Development-only code
- Date picker debugging (can be removed in production)
- Error logging that should remain for debugging
